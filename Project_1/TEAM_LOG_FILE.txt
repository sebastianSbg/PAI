- Noticed that either load_and_transform_data caused a lot of unstability in the score, therofore I uncommented it. Choose first 800 datapoints to fit to. Score of ~0.02 from score function (not docker)
- RationalQuadratic() + WhiteKernel() seems to perfom best thus far
- System crashes very frequently with 800 data points or so - considering using google colab, since it's all handles with the server. Crashes are recovered more easily plus there is more RAM available
- Here is data on the Nystroem approximation: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.kernel_approximation.Nystroem.html
- Perhaps we should consider normailzing the data?
