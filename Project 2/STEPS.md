## Build Bayesian NN

1. Initialization of priors (mean and std) 
- Should they be arrays?
- Difference between weight and prior?

3. Write code for KL divergence between Gaussian prior and posterior (In a single layer and in the entire network)

4. Write code for Forward propagation in a Layer
- Should the output be a number or a probability distribution?
## Train Bayesian NN

1. Modified loss function (additional KL divergence) ?

2. Predict class probabilities

## Main

1. Optimize parameters of the network: learning rate, epochs, priors and batch size
